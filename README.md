As part of our ongoing efforts to understand and address workforce dynamics, I was tasked with creating a comprehensive dashboard in PowerBI that highlights key trends in employee hiring, promotions, and turnover rates during the FY 2020-21 period. This dashboard is specifically designed to break down these trends by gender, allowing us to identify any potential gender inequality within our organization.

The dashboard not only presents data on how employees were hired, promoted, or left the company during this period but also enables a deeper analysis of these trends across different departments and job levels. By examining these patterns, the company aims to uncover underlying factors contributing to employee turnover, particularly in relation to gender disparities. The insights derived from this analysis will be instrumental in shaping our strategies to improve employee retention and promote a more equitable workplace
